## üîß Production Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04+ server with root access
- Domain pointing to server IP: `dashboard.aigrowise.com`
- DigitalOcean Spaces bucket created

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# 1. Copy project to server
scp -r bmad-aigrowise/ root@dashboard.aigrowise.com:/var/www/

# 2. SSH to server and run deployment script
ssh root@dashboard.aigrowise.com
cd /var/www/aigrowise
chmod +x scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
./scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
```

### Manual Deployment Steps
Follow the detailed guide in `PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT.md`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Required

### 1. DigitalOcean Spaces Setup
Create a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket and update environment variables:

```bash
# In production environment or PM2 ecosystem.config.js
DO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY="your-spaces-access-key"
DO_SPACES_SECRET_KEY="your-spaces-secret-key"
DO_SPACES_BUCKET="aigrowise-ndvi-images"
DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com"
DO_SPACES_REGION="nyc3"
```

### 2. Database Credentials
Update database connection if different from defaults:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://aigrowise_user:aigrowise_pass@localhost:5432/aigrowise_production"
```

### 3. Authentication Secret
Generate a secure secret for production:
```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secure-secret-here"
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Application Testing
- [ ] Health check endpoint: `https://dashboard.aigrowise.com/api/health`
- [ ] Login page loads: `https://dashboard.aigrowise.com/login`
- [ ] Admin login works with created admin account
- [ ] Client account creation from admin panel
- [ ] Image upload functionality (requires Spaces configuration)
- [ ] Client dashboard displays uploaded images
- [ ] File upload size limits (50MB max)
- [ ] HTTPS redirect from HTTP

### Security Testing
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] Security headers present (check with securityheaders.com)
- [ ] File upload restrictions working
- [ ] Admin-only areas protected from clients
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times under 2 seconds
- [ ] Image uploads complete successfully
- [ ] Large file handling (test with ~10MB TIFF)
- [ ] Concurrent user sessions
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load

## üìä Production Monitoring

### Health Monitoring
- **Endpoint**: `https://dashboard.aigrowise.com/api/health`
- **Expected Response**: Status 200 with database and storage checks
- **Monitoring**: Set up external monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot, etc.)

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# PM2 Logs
pm2 logs aigrowise-ndvi-hub

# Nginx Logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/aigrowise-access.log
tail -f /var/log/nginx/aigrowise-error.log

# System Resources
pm2 monit
```

### Database Monitoring
```bash
# Check database connectivity
sudo -u postgres psql aigrowise_production -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"User\";"

# Monitor database size
sudo -u postgres psql aigrowise_production -c "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('aigrowise_production'));"
```

## üîÑ Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
- [ ] Check application health endpoint
- [ ] Monitor PM2 process status
- [ ] Review error logs for issues

### Weekly
- [ ] Check SSL certificate expiry
- [ ] Review disk space usage
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Check backup integrity

### Monthly
- [ ] Update system packages: `apt update && apt upgrade`
- [ ] Review and rotate logs
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Security audit of dependencies

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**502 Bad Gateway**
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status
pm2 restart aigrowise-ndvi-hub

# Check Nginx configuration
nginx -t
