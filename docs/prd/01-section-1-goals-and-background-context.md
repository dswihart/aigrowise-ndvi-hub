### **Section 1: Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

* To provide a secure, centralized platform for Aigrowise clients to store and access their NDVI imagery.
* To ensure strict data privacy and isolation, where each client can only view data associated with their specific location or account.
* To deliver a user-friendly web interface that simplifies viewing and managing agricultural image data.
* To build the application using the Next.js framework and ensure it is deployable as a Digital Ocean Droplet.

#### **Background Context**

Aigrowise provides valuable NDVI imagery to its clients for agricultural monitoring. Currently, the lack of a centralized platform for clients to access this data can lead to inefficient data sharing and difficulty in tracking historical imagery.

This project will create a dedicated web portal, "Aigrowise NDVI Hub," to solve this problem. The hub will serve as a secure, value-added service, giving each client a single point of access to their location-specific data. This will enhance customer satisfaction, improve data accessibility, and provide a professional interface for Aigrowise's services.
