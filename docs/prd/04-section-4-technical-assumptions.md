### **Section 4: Technical Assumptions**

#### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

A monorepo is recommended to simplify dependency management and ensure consistency between the API and the user interface.

#### **Service Architecture: Monolithic Application**

The application will be a single, unified project where the frontend and backend API routes are developed and deployed together, which is the standard approach for Next.js.

#### **Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration Tests**

The project will include unit tests for individual components and integration tests to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.

#### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

* **Database**: The application will require a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
* **Image Storage**: The application should use a dedicated object storage service, such as DigitalOcean Spaces.
