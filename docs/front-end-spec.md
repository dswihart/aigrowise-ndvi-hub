# Aigrowise NDVI Hub UI/UX Specification

### **Section 1: Overall UX Goals & Principles**

  * **Target User Personas**:
      * **The Client**: An Aigrowise customer who needs simple, secure, and immediate access to their specific NDVI data.
      * **The Administrator**: An internal Aigrowise user responsible for uploading and managing client data.
  * **Usability Goals**:
      * **Ease of Learning**: A first-time client should be able to log in and find their images in under a minute.
      * **Efficiency**: An administrator should be able to upload a new image and assign it to a client in less than 90 seconds.
      * **Error Prevention**: The design should minimize the chance of an administrator assigning an image to the wrong client.
  * **Design Principles**:
    1.  Clarity First
    2.  Effortless Security
    3.  Focused Workflows

### **Section 2: Information Architecture (IA)**

  * **Site Map**:
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        subgraph Client Area
            A[Login Page] --> B[Client Dashboard / Image Gallery];
        end
        subgraph Admin Area
            C[Admin Login Page] --> D[Admin Dashboard];
            D --> E[Image Management];
        end
        B -- Logout --> A;
        E -- Logout --> C;
    ```
  * **Navigation Structure**: Client navigation is focused on the dashboard with a logout link. Admin navigation includes links to key areas like Image Management.

### **Section 3: User Flows**

  * **Flow 1: Client Views Images**: A logged-in client lands on their dashboard, the system fetches their images, and displays them in a gallery.
  * **Flow 2: Admin Uploads Image for Client**: An admin selects a client and an image, uploads the file, and the system assigns it to the client, providing clear feedback.

### **Section 4: Wireframes & Mockups**

  * **Primary Design Files**: [Link to Figma, Sketch, or other design tool will go here]
  * **Key Screen Layouts**: Conceptual layouts for the Client Login, Client Dashboard, and Admin Image Management pages have been defined.

### **Section 5: Component Library / Design System**

  * **Design System Approach**: Use the **Shadcn/ui** component collection for Next.js/React and Tailwind CSS.
  * **Core Components**: Button, Input, Card, Dialog/Modal, Toast/Notification, Data Table.

### **Section 6: Branding & Style Guide**

  * **Color Palette**: Primary Green (approx. `#34D399`), Secondary Charcoal (approx. `#1F2937`), and a light gray background.
  * **Typography**: Headings: **Poppins**, Body: **Inter**.

### **Section 7: Accessibility Requirements**

  * **Standard**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA. This includes requirements for color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper content structure.
  * **Compliance**: The project will include a requirement for GDPR compliance, necessitating features like a cookie consent banner and clear privacy policy links.

### **Section 8: Responsiveness Strategy**

  * **Breakpoints**: Standard mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints will be used.
  * **Approach**: A mobile-first design strategy will be employed, ensuring layouts adapt from single-column to multi-column.

### **Section 9: Animation & Micro-interactions**

  * **Motion Principles**: Animations will be subtle, purposeful, and performant.
  * **Key Animations**: Includes feedback for button clicks, form field focus, loading states, and page transitions.

### **Section 10: Performance Considerations**

  * **Goals**: Aims to meet Google's Core Web Vitals for page load (\<2.5s) and interaction response (\<200ms).
  * **Strategies**: Image optimization, lazy loading, and code splitting.
