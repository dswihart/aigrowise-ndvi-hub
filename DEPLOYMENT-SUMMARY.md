## 🎯 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Immediate Next Steps
```bash
# 1. Deploy to your DigitalOcean server
scp -r bmad-aigrowise/ root@dashboard.aigrowise.com:/var/www/

# 2. Run the automated deployment script
ssh root@dashboard.aigrowise.com
cd /var/www/aigrowise
chmod +x scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
./scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
```

### 2. Configure DigitalOcean Spaces
- Create a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket named `aigrowise-ndvi-images`
- Generate access keys and update environment variables
- Test image upload functionality

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Check health endpoint: `https://dashboard.aigrowise.com/api/health`
